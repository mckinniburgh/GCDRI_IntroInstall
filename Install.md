#Installations

**You will need:**
* The computer you'll be using for the GC DRI
* Green sticky notes and red sticky notes
* The insights of your peers!

For those of you who have installed a new type of software before, you might agree that installation can be even trickier than learning the first few steps of the software itself. But we are here to help!

For today's workshops on Command Line and Git, we requested in advance via email that you complete installations before arriving. If you haven't had a chance to do so yet, we'll have a bit of time to make sure everyone is all set right now.

Take a moment and review the instructions for today's installation, and then follow the instructions for sticky notes below. 
 
##OSX Quick Instructions

1. Go to the Finder (magnifying glass in top right of your desktop) and type "terminal" in the prompt. The terminal application should be the first item that appears. When you see the $ (dollar sign) with your computer's name, you're in the right place.
2. At the $ prompt, type:

xcode-select --install

You may need to accept the licensing agreement that will appear before xcode will install.

3. Download and install Git.
4. Download and install Sublime Text.
3. Sign up for GitHub.
 
##Windows Quick Instructions

1. Download and install Git (comes with Git Bash). The default settings are fine.
2. Download and install Sublime Text.
3. Sign up for GitHub.
 
##Sticky Note Instructions

####Place a green sticky note on the top of your computer...
if you have all of the steps complete and feel good to go.

####Place a red sticky note on the top of your computer...
if you still need to complete a few steps. Go ahead and follow the directions below. 

####Place two (2) red sticky notes on the top of your computer...
if you encountered errors in your installation, or have already started the installation and have a specific question. Someone will work their way around the room to help you out.  

#### Bonus round: If you have a green sticky note...

Congrats! You have two choices, both equally valiant! You can break early for a cup of coffee, and meet back here at **11:25am** to get started on the command line workshop, OR, in the spirit of the week, wander over to a person who has two red sticky notes on their computer and see if you can troubleshoot together for five minutes. Sometimes we just need an extra set of eyes, regardless of expertise! 

If you choose this option and solve the installation problem, you both get a prize!


##Detailed instructions for OSX and Windows:

###Command Line

The command line is an interface to provide text-based instructions to your operating system. On OSX, we'll be using the built-in terminal application, but we ask you to perform one additional step (see below). For Windows, we'll be using Git Bash, which comes bundled when you install Git.

For Windows, download and install Git (comes with Git Bash). The default settings are fine.

For OSX:

1) Go to "Applications," then "Utilities," and click on "terminal" to open the application. You can also type "terminal" in the finder (magnifying glass at the top right of your desktop).

2) Type the following in the terminal window you've just opened:

xcode-select --install

###Git

Git is a version control software that works locally on your computer, while GitHub is a web-based service that allows you to make your Git files available remotely.

For OSX/Linux, download Git here.

For Windows, download at this link: Git Windows tools.

You'll want to register for an account at GitHub, and be sure to remember your username and password--we'll need it during the Digital Research Institute.

###Text Editor

A text editor is an application for working with plain text, such as .txt, markdown, HTML, or Python code. We will be using the Sublime text editor because it supports syntax highlighting (which makes it easier to catch mistakes in your code) and works on every operating system. You can download Sublime here. Note that you may be prompted to purchase the full version of Sublime when you open the application, but this isn't necessary.

# Introductions and Installation 

##**GC Digital Research Institute**
###January 17-20, 2017

We'll be working collaboratively over the next four days to learn digital skills, practice interdisciplinary research, and hone our own projects. First things first: let's meet the GC DRI Class of January 2017!

We'll start with an icebreaker on a mission: to introduce ourselves to each other, and demonstrate the variety of specific and broad research goals each of us brings to the GC DRI.

# Activity 1

Using a notecard, write down *two keywords* that you feel describe your research (especially as it relates to digital work). Simple words are great--"database," "archives," "websites." We know you're far more complex than your keywords--but distillation is king.

Turn to the person next to you and say hi! Go ahead and discuss your keywords, revise them if it makes sense, and enjoy hearing about your new neighbor's approach to the week you'll share together.

After you've had a chance to introduce yourself, we'll go around the room and all together say *three* quick things: 

1. our *name*
2. our *program*
3. our *two* keywords.

After you've had a chance to share this aloud, go ahead and type the same information here: [http://pad.software-carpentry.org/gcdrijan2017](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/gcdrijan2017) 

We'll keep tally of all the keywords, and this will start to give us an idea of the different disciplines, ideas, and learning objectives each of us will bring to the table this coming week.

#First Day, First Session

We'll be working collaboratively over the next four days to learn digital skills, practice interdisciplinary research, and hone our own projects. 

This session will contain two introductory activities, designed to get you meeting people, sharing your research interests, and getting all set for the week ahead. Then, we'll work together to ensure we have everything installed for our Command Line workshop.

# Activity 2

As we went around the room, maybe you heard someone say a research topic that intrigues you. Maybe there are a few people you'd like to meet based on keyword alone, or who may be in your same program. Now's your first chance of many to say hi!

###Organize a small group of people. 
You can use the list of names and interests on the Etherpad to create a crew of similar interests, of purposely diverse interests, or simply choose the people closest to you. 

###Together, discuss the following two questions:

###1. What is a skill that I *already* bring to the table, before we even start classes at the GC DRI?

(this can be technical or non-technical--we'll learn that both are very valuable in learning digital skills)
	
###2. What is a single learning goal that I'd like to set for this week?

####Instead of saying: 
Learn Python. 

####Try: 
Understand the basics of Python in order to see whether it might be worth pursuing for my own research project. 

*Why? Learning a whole programming language is built of multiple smaller goals, like understanding functions, memorizing syntax in steps, and more. Choose a manageable goal that directly informs an upcoming task you'll need to get done--the purpose of this week is to assist you in developing the technical and critical skills to choose the right digital methods and tools for your work.*
	
Write down your skill and goal, and keep it in a place you can see during this week.

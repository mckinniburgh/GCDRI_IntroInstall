# Activity 2

As we went around the room, maybe you heard someone say a research topic that intrigues you. Maybe there are a few people you'd like to meet based on keyword alone, or who may be in your same program. Now's your first chance of many to say hi!

*Organize a small group of people. You can use the list of names and interests on the Etherpad to create a crew of similar interests, of purposely diverse interests, or simply choose the people closest to you. 

*Together, discuss the following two questions:

1. What is a skill that I *already* bring to the table, before we even start classes at the GC DRI?

(this can be technical or non-technical--we'll learn that both are very valuable in learning digital skills)

Examples: MC has a good eye for organization
		  Jojo is great at finding new people to speak with and learn from
		  Patrick has a knack for focusing on anything until he gets it to work	
		
2. What is a single learning goal that I'd like to set for this week?

Bad example: Learn Python. 
	*Why? Learning a whole programming language is built of multiple smaller goals, like understanding functions, memorizing syntax in steps, trying different applications, etc.*

Good example: Understand the basics of Python in order to see whether it might be worth pursuing for my own research project. 

	*Why? This goal is manageable and has an applied purpose--double whammy!*
